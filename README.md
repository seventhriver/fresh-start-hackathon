# Hackathon
## NOTE: WE DID DEV BY SSHING INTO ADHI'S MACHINE, A COOL NEW INNOVATIVE STRATEGY


Here's a  full-stack idea: "ProduceSaver: Smart Food Bank Distribution Network"
Problem:
Grocery stores and restaurants throw away tons of perfectly good food daily, while food banks struggle to get enough fresh produce and perishables. The main issue isn't lack of willing donors, but logistics - getting food from point A to B before it spoils.
Full Stack Solution:
Frontend:

Progressive Web App for all users
Real-time dashboard showing:

Available food items and expiry times
Closest pickup/dropoff points
Route optimization
Impact metrics (food saved, people fed)
Temperature tracking for cold chain items


Separate interfaces for:

Donors (stores/restaurants)
Volunteer drivers
Food banks
Administrators



Backend:

Node.js/Express API
PostgreSQL for user/organization data
Redis for real-time delivery tracking
Features:

Route optimization algorithm
Real-time matching of donors with nearby drivers
Temperature monitoring system
Predictive analytics for food availability
Automatic donor tax receipt generation
Food safety compliance tracking
Integration with delivery apps' driver networks



Key Technical Challenges:

Building efficient routing algorithm
Real-time tracking and notifications
Cold chain monitoring
Handling sudden schedule changes
Scaling during donation spikes
Managing multiple stakeholder needs
Predicting food shelf life

What makes it special:

Solves two problems: food waste and hunger
Real-time coordination is technically challenging
Multiple user types with different needs
Requires smart algorithms
Has measurable impact
Can start local and scale globally
Involves hardware integration (temperature sensors)

This is perfect for a hackathon because it:

Has immediate real-world impact
Requires full-stack skills
Involves interesting algorithms
Can be MVP'd quickly
Has room for innovation
Tackles a universal problem
Could actually be implemented
